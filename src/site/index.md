## This site is just starting up

The Japanese government (and other sites) offers a wealth of open data about Japan, its economy and people. However, this data is often difficult to use: Descriptions and column names are available only in Japanese, data comes in human-readable Excel reports (or worse: PDFs) and is not ready to be machine-read. The data is often already summarised and it is difficult to find more granular data among the millions of files listed.

We want to make this data more accessible and provide curated data sets:

- Truly machine-readable
- Ready to be analysed
- Descriptions and column names in English
- Multiple files that belong together are combined

*There is no data to download here yet. We are currently working hard to bring you open data from Japan. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to david@ on this domain.*
